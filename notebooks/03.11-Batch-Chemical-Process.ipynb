    "    \"... a small, single-product batch chemical plant has three identical reactors in parallel, followed by a single storage tank and a batch still. Customer orders (batches) to be filled (which begin with processing in the reactor) occur every 115 ± 30 minutes, uniformly distributed. The reaction time in a given reactor is 335 ± 60 minutes, and the distillation time in the still is 110 ± 25 minutes, both times uniformly distributed. The holding capacity of the storage tank is exactly one batch. Hence, the storage tank must be empty for a given reactor to discharge its batch; if not, the reactor cannot begin processing a new batch until the storage tank becomes empty. The simulation is to be run for 100 batches. The model should have the capability to collect waiting line statistics for the queue immediately upstream of the reactor.\"\"\n",
