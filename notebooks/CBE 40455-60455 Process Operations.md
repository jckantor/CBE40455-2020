### Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) Model

| Compartment|Description|
|:--|:--|
|**Susceptible**|Individuals who are susceptible to infection
|**Infectious**|Infected individuals who are capable of infecting others
|**Recovered**|Individuals who have recovered, no longer infectious, and assumed to immune

Overall population balance: $N = S + I + R$


$$\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} & = -\beta S \frac{I}{N} \\
\frac{dI}{dt} & = \beta S \frac{I}{N} - \gamma I \\
\frac{dR}{dt} & = \gamma I
\end{align*}$$
